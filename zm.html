<!--













I am transhuman.

In an aim to integrate creativity and reason

for the purpose of self-awareness and longevity

—promoted by persistence

aware of odds, informed by risk,

alert to new discovery, welcoming challenge,

ever-changing—

I become.

I am the architect of my existence. My life reflects my vision and represents my values. It conveys the very essence of my being—coalescing imagination and reason, 

challenging all limits.
